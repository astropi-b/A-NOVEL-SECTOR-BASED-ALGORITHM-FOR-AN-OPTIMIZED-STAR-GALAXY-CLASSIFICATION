We test different models on the data from two sectors, and we test that model on the third sector data. Here we have sector 7, sector 10, and sector 16.

1. The naming of files is in order for the model_sector that is using that sector data to be tested, i.e., trained using other sector data.
2. For the MargNet model, everything is in the same notebook.
